    ### Design description
    Based around 8 Features on content on bank loan advertisement.
    -Photography, Suggestions, Etc.
    This is for a single bank in South Africa. 

    ### Data
    South Africa - Bank Loan RCT - 53,650 Observations

    ### Original results
    -The main result on price is that the probability of applying before 
    the deadline (8.5% in the full sample) rose 0.3 of a percentage point for
    every 100â€“basis point reduction in the monthly interest rate.
    -Three variables show significant increases in takeup: one example loan,
    no suggested loan use, and female photo.
    -Option value (longer deadlines make the offer more valuable and induce takeup)
    dominates any time management problem in our context: takeup and loan amount 
    increased dramatically with deadline length.

    <<Generally we can say that it is helpful for heteregenous effect and finding the particular effect
    of one treatment effect. In this case, we will be studying being a high-risk creditor to the outcome
    of applying to the offered loan. Also, we considere that causal trees and causal forest are crucial 
    for data analysis when seeking to understand complex and heterogeneous causal relationships.
